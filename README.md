# [ClassBrowser](https://classbrowser.net)

A web app to browse Lafayette College's course catalog. Its built using a Python parse which takes a downloaded page containing all the courses and outputs the data in several different formats. That data is then used by the frontend which is built in Svelte using TailwindCSS to neatly display the data.

### Why

This was built primarily to enable filtering of classes by common core requirements. It also provides a powerful search bar to help find classes that you might be interested in.
